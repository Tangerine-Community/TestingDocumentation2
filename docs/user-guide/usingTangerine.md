# Using Tangerine outside of the box

Here you will see how you can use Tangerine beyond EGRA/EGMA assessments or sruvey. 

## Timed observations

---------------------------
It maybe the case where you would like to observe what is happening in the classroom every 5 mins and answer a series of questions during this time. Once the timer runs out the next observation interval starts. This scenario is doable out of the box with Tangerine.

Here are the steps to follow to implement a timed interval observation:

- Create the start page(s) - here you can collect the begin time, the gps coordinates, the location input, or anything else that pertains to the observation.

- Create the questions you want to answer each X seconds/minutes. Make sure they are all optional (not required).
- Insert an EF Touch input which will control the time limit.
- Insert a question to control if the observation should terminate early.
- In our example we have also inserted a JS script to show the count down to the user.
- Create a last page to collect comments.
