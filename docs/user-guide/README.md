- [Tangerine group management and releases](groupMangement.md)
- [Tangerine data collection](dataCollection.md)

The Tangerine form development process and release is as follows:

- Create a group.
- Develop your forms in this group (form rendering).
- Test your forms and adjust where necessary.
- Create a release - this generates a Chrome web install or a APK install.
- Install the app onto a device.
- Register the device user (each device has independent set of users).
- Conduct your data collection on the device.
- Synchronize the results from the device to the server. NOTE: this is done only manually
- Download the csv from the server to analyse the data.
- Update the app on the device. As an optional step that can be done at any point in the form development, you can create a release and update the tablet application by using the Check for Updates link
