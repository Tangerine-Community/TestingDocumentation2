Data collection on Device
--------------------------

Select the instrument to use, and follow the prompts, sections, and
items on the screen, as generated in the instrument/form editor. To
select an answer option, just tab on it.

**NOTE**: Different to all other inputs, where the user/assessor selects
the applicable / correct response which will then be marked in blue, in
grids, the user has to select all **INCORRECT** items (they will turn
blue).

Resuming Instrument
-------------------

Should an administration be interrupted, or to be completed at a later
stage, navigate to "**Visits**" on the top of the tablet screen.

**NOTE**: You have to have a location section and location list loaded
for your instrument to be able to access the resume feature in
Tangerine. Make up a location list, even if it only has one column
header entry and one item underneath (e.g. column A header is "site",
row 2 entry is "test site". Without a location list loaded, you will not
have a "Visits" tab on the tablet from which to resume the instrument.

Select the appropriate location and date (as applicable) from the menu.
Tangerine will automatically return the user to the last, incomplete
section/page of the instrument.

You can return from the "Visits" page to the main screen by hitting the
Tangerine icon.
